== Takeoff 

Takeoff is my personal take on a Rails barebone application. I'm using it myself, feel free to fork if you like it.

== Guidelines

* No Rails tutorial-like comment stuff
* Proper gitignore, vim-oriented
* Haml / Sass
* Authlogic for authorization
* jQuery for javascript
* All of my usual helpers

== TODO

* strip app to the bones
* gitignore
* jquery
* add haml/sass
* add authlogic
* collect custom helpers
